    |   |       |   +---InterventionDescription:
    |   |       |         The 6MST is done using a stepper (Stepper essential, Decathlon(TM), France), with a walking height of 20 cm, placed in front of a wall or parallel bars, so patients can hold on if necessary.
    |   |       |         Patients are instructed to make the maximum number of steps possible in 6 minutes, and are given a time check at one minute intervals.

    |   |           |   
    |   |           +---InterventionDescription:  The STST is done using a chair measuring 47 cm in height. The patient are instructed to sit in the chair and then to do the maximum number of lifts possible from the chair, in 1 minute, with arms folded and without leaning against the chair.
